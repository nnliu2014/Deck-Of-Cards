//  Class Name : DeckTester
//
//  Description: Testing class for Deck class.
//  1. testDeckCreation will check if a new Deck has all the Cards created correctly.
//  2. testInitialShuffle will check:
//      a. a permutation is done
//      b. no duplicated Cards
//      Correctness of the Cards is not checked since only the contructor can create Cards.
//  3. testDeckShuffleRandomness will check if multiple calls to shuffle() will generate different
//     random permutations. This is to ensure the fairness of the game.
//  4. testMultipleDeckShuffle will check if shuffle calls to multiple Decks will generate different
//     random permutations. This is also to ensure the fairness of the game.
//  5. testDealOneCard will test the case of dealing from a fresh Deck and a Deck after one shuffle
//     call.
//  6. testDealCards will test the case where several Cards are dealt continuously.
//  7. testDealEmptyDeck will test the case when dealOneCard() is called when the Deck is empty.
//  8. testShuffleAfterDealing will test the case when shuffle() is called on a partial Deck.
//
//  As explained in Deck.hpp, thread saftey is not tested in these test cases.
