//  Class Name: Deck
//
//  Description: One Deck hold 52 different Cards in four suits defined in PokerSuit and with face values
//  defined in PokerRank.

//  1. Deck class support one default constructor, and one copy constructor for testing purposes. The Cards
//  are created at construction of the Deck object and can only be dealt out. Currently implementation does
//  not support a card to be added back to a Deck.
//
//  2. Ownership of a Card is exclusive: only one container can hold the Card at anytime. In
//  real world, this means one card is either in the deck, or is dealt to a player. This is supported by
//  using unique_ptr in the implementation.

//  3. shuffle() return no values but will randomly permute the cards in the Deck. It can be called multiple
//  times.
//
//  4. dealOneCard() will pass the ownership of the Card to the caller. When the Deck is empty, no Card will
//  be returned. The caller need to check the content of the unique_ptr to check if a Card is dealt
//  successfully.
//
//  5. getSize() will return the numbe of Cards, currently in the Deck.
//
//  Other considerations:
//  Thread safty is not considered in this design as the ownership of Deck shall also be exclusive.
//  One Deck can only be in one hand.
